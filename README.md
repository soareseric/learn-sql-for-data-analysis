I am building this repository for study purposes. I am on the journey to become a Data Analyst, and I want to share what I have learned along the way.

## About the Content

The content of this repository cover the essencial SQL commands. I will follow the book "Getting Started with SQL" by Thomas Nield publish by O'REILLY. Besides that, we explore SQL for data analysis.

Note 1: All of this content is written in the form of "notes" by me. I encourage you to take some time and read the official documentation for the SQL language. I will always provide these references and others at the end of each topic.

Note 2: At the time of viewing this, I may still be in the process of developing the content and updating this repository. As a result, you may encounter some unclickable topics. The updates to these topics do not follow a specific order and are based on my needs and study progress. Follow me to stay updated on new upgrades.
